## It has 3 modes:
1. Saves all found ways to place upgrades. The less holes there is, the higher it will be in the output file
2. When script finds a way to place upgrades more efficient or equally to the previous best, it saves it
3. You enter a number, then the script finds all the ways to set upgrades so the count of holes will be less than your number.
    The less holes there is, the higher it will be
____

## HOWTO
- Run main.py
- Enter:
    1. The number of the mode you need (from 1 to 3)
    2. Ids of the upgrades you want to be placed space-separated (ex: 1 4 8 6 13 )
    3. If you've chosen 3 mode, you need to enter the limit of holes
- Just wait. When it's done working the ~~ugly~~ gorgeous cmd will close and "**** Upgrades.txt" file will appear
